Here I have built a Machine Learning model to predict the delay occured by using the train data to train the model and then testing it on the test data.
I have found the delay from the train data by finding the difference between the due date and clear date and thus tried to predict the delay on the test data so that the clear date can be calculated using the delay and the due date.
I have also built a table to visualize and display the table of the test data and the predicted delay and aging bucket of the delay occured.
